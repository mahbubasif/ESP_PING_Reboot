# ESP_PING_Reboot
This code is for my automatic router rebooting project. 
We have used a relay module connected with an ESP8266 based dev board. ESP will ping google and other sites every 5 minutes. In case of a successful ping, the router will stay powered on. But if the ping fails router will be automatically rebooted by the relay module.Â
